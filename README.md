#  Machine Learning From Scratch (Python + NumPy)

This repository contains clean and well-documented implementations of **machine learning algorithms from scratch** using only **Python** and **NumPy** (without libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow). It’s built for learning, experimentation, and understanding how ML models work under the hood.
