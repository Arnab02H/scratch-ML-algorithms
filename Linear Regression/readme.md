# 📘 Linear Regression from Scratch with Python and NumPy

This project demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression** from scratch using **Batch Gradient Descent**, **Stochastic Gradient Descent**, and **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**. It uses only **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas** to provide a clear and educational look at how gradient descent works under the hood.
